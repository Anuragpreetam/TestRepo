What is Git?

Git is a 'Version control System' for tracking changes
in computer files.

->Distributed Version control
->Coordinates work b/w multiple devs
->Who made what changes and when
->Revert back at anytime
->Local & remote repos.

Are you tired of switching between different windows to edit code, review changes, and push your commits to GitHub?

Usually when you use git you'll have a repo on your Local
machine that you work on , make changes and then you upload it to 
or push it to a remote repo(ex : github or bitbucket)
